				<p>
					The City of Barberton will begin picking up loose leaves beginning October 21st and will continue for at least 6 weeks depending on how mother-nature cooperates.
					To facilitate pickup, leaves must be raked into a row and placed in the street no more than two (2) feet from the curb or the edge of the street without obstructing traffic.
					Please note the dates/schedule that we will be in each ward and keep in mind that as the weather gets worse and the leaves fall faster it may take longer for us to return to your area.
					The leaves must be out prior to the day that we are scheduled to be in your ward.
					Please do not wait until you see the equipment/crews in your ward.
				</p><p>
					Please note that the following schedule is for the streets without curbs.

					Please note that the sweeper will be pushing the leaves between the hours of 11:00 pm and 7:00 am.
					Cars parked on the streets between these hours will receive tickets according to Ordinance #6-1993.
				</p><p>
					For those residents that wish to have immediate service we are offering the following options:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You may take bagged leaves to Mulch Makers of Ohio located at 3307 Clark Mill Road. Their hours are Monday – Friday 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. They are asking that you stop in the office and they will direct you where to go.  Please note that you must de-bag the leaves yourself, which allows you to re-use your bags.</li>
					<li>Bagged leaves can also be brought to the following drop off areas:  Newton Park, Edgewood Park (27th St. parking lot) and Tuscora Park.  If you wish to re-use your bags you may dump out your leaves in the “loose pile” or just place the bagged leaves in the appropriate area.  Signs will be posted.</li>
