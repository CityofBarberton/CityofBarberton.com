#### Street Sweeping

**City of Barberton, Ohio (April 2, 2013)** – The city will be sweeping streets from April 21, 2013 through December 5, 2013, weather permitting. The street sweeper schedule for the City of Barberton is as follows:

 - Tue - Near westside
 - Wed - Far westside
 - Thu - Downtown area
	
Reminder: Do not put trash, branches, or grass clippings in the road. Basketball poles and rims are not to be placed within the street right-of-way without proper authorization as it will be difficult for our street sweepers to maneuver without causing damage to the equipment.
