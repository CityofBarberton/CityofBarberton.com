				<p>
					Since Barberton's founding in 1891 by noted industrialist Ohio Columbus Barber, Barberton has been an innovative community in industry and new technology. Barber's Diamond Match company was a leading producer of wooden matches in 1891. Later, Barber developed an elaborate farm complex made up of some 40 brick barns and 400 acres, giving the nation one of the first agracorps and experimental farms.
				</p><p>					
					This spirit of innovation continues to thrive in Barberton today. It is a center of research for Babcock and Wilcox Nuclear and Fossil Fuel Divisions and is home to PPG's manufacturing of Teslinâ„¢, a synthetic polymer paper. A diversity of smaller companies also play a vital role in Barberton's economy.
				</p><p>
