				LAKE ANNA PARK: Please keep in mind that this festival is held outdoors in a lake-site park with areas of rolling, uneven contours, trees and sloping walkways. Vehicles and overnight camping are not permitted in the park. Park regulations prohibit pets and alcohol. A map and information about motels and campgrounds in the area will be sent, if requested.
				</p><p>
				BOOTH SIZE: Exhibitors will be allotted an area as described in the fee schedule. Tents or other structures used must fit into the allotted area. If crafter exceeds the allotted area, exhibitor will be charged for an additional space. All stakes used to hold down or secure a booth covering must have protective corners. Stakes or ropes are not to be located in the aisles or walkways. It is recommended that craft exhibitors use some kind of covering to protect booth contents and workers from the weather. Wind and rain can be devastating to booths that are not well secured and properly protected. Approval of tents or booth coverings is at the discretion of the Mum Fest coordinators to provide safety for participants and those attending the show. Coordinators reserve the right to disapprove tents or booth coverings and deny permission for set up or require the removal of unacceptable tents or coverings.
				</p><p>
				CRAFTER HOURS: Hours for crafters are Mum Fest hours. All crafters must keep their booths intact both days. Permission for a crafter to leave early will be granted only in a medical or emergency situation. Any exhibitor leaving without permission from the Mum Fest organizers will not be accepted for any future shows.
				</p><p>
				TRASH REMOVAL &amp; CLEAN UP: All vendors are responsible for the removal of their refuse and discarded items. All vendors MUST keep their respective areas neat and clean and provide sufficient trash liners &amp; receptacles for their booth. All refuse MUST be cleaned up from the area immediately at the close of the Mum Fest each day. The ultimate responsibility for trash cleanup is that of the vendor.
				</p><p>
				VENDOR UNLOADING/PARKING: Immediately AFTER unloading and BEFORE setup is started, all vehicles must be moved to the designated parking area as unloading space is very limited. Vendor vehicles must be moved to the parking area at least 30 minutes BEFORE the Mum Fest opens each day by order of the Fire Department as a fire lane must be maintained at all times. Vendor vehicles will not be permitted into the exhibit areas or on the pathway in the park once the show has started because of pedestrian traffic. Please make sure you have sufficient supplies in your booth for the day.
