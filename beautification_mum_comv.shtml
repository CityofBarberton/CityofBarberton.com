				BOOTH SIZE:  Exhibitors will be allotted an area as described in the fee schedule.  All tents or structures must fit into the allotted area.  If exhibitor exceeds the allotted area, exhibitor will be charged for an additional space.  You must note on the copy of the contract you sign and return the size of your exhibit and how many spaces you require.  All stakes used to hold down or secure a booth covering must have protective corners.  Stakes or ropes are not to be located in the aisles or walkways.  It is recommended that exhibitors use some kind of covering to protect booth contents and workers from the weather.  Wind and rain can be devastating to booths that are not well secured and properly protected.  Approval of tents or booth coverings is at the discretion of the Mum Fest organizers to provide safety for participants and those attending the show.  The Mum Fest organizers reserve the right to disapprove tents or booth coverings and deny permission for set up or require the removal of unacceptable tents or coverings.
