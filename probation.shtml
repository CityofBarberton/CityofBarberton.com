				<h4>Community Service</h4>

					The Community Service Program is a cost effective and efficient sentencing alternative that responds to the needs of the Court and of the community. In appropriate cases, defendants are sentenced to perform hours of service as ordered by the court, as an alternative to jail. Defendants have been ordered to work at numerous nonprofit and governmental agencies in the Barberton Municipal Court District as part of community service.
