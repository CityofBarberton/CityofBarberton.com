				<h4 id="commonquestions">Common Questions</h4>
					<h5>Can I call to request time to pay my fine?</h5>
					<p>
						No, you must appear in court on the court date and ask the Judge for time to pay.
					</p>
					 
					<h5>I forgot to pay my citation on time. Can I mail it on the court date?</h5>
					<p>
						If you have a waiverable citation, you must add a $5.00 late fee if you pay after your court date (you must do so within 30 days of your Court date).
					</p>
					 
					<h5>I forgot to show my insurance card to the officer and was told if I bring it in, I can just pay my fine. Is this correct?</h5>
					<p>
						Yes, if you have a waiverable citation you can mail or bring in a copy of your insurance card or policy showing coverage for the date of your violation.
					</p>
					 
					<h5>Will my fine be different if I come to court? How do I know how much money to bring?</h5>
					<p>
						The Judge determines the fine amount in court and there is no way of knowing what you will pay prior to your court appearance. The Judge reviews the records, listens to your comments, and bases his decision on all the information given. If you do not have money on the day of your appearance and your fines and costs exceed $100.00, the Court will sometimes allow you additional time to pay your fine. This is referred to as a payment agreement. There is a $20.00 fee for being placed on a payment agreement.
					</p>
					 
					<h5>I did not have insurance on the day I received my citation. Will my license be suspended? For how long?</h5>
					<p>
						Yes, your license will be suspended for 90 days by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
					</p>
					 
					<h5>Can I get driving privileges while my license is suspended?</h5>
					<p>
						Contact the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
