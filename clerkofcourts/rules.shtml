				</p>
				
				<h4 id="lcrule-19">RULE No. 19 &ndash; JURY TRIALS</h4>
				<p>
					(A) Civil<br>
					A demand for trial by jury shall be made in accordance with Civ.R.38. To obtain a jury in a civil case, a written jury demand shall be filed with the Clerk, together with a jury deposit in the sum of $300.00. If no number is specified on the jury demand, the number of jurors shall be eight (8). To be effective, a jury demand requires both a written request and a $300.00 deposit. The $300.00 deposit may be waived upon determination by the Judge that the party making the jury demand is indigent. The nonprevailing side shall be responsible for jury costs unless the Court otherwise directs.
				</p><p>
					(B) Criminal/Traffic<br>
					Where there is a right of jury trial, the jury demand shall be made in accordance with Crim.R.23. In criminal and traffic cases, the Defendant, if found guilty, shall be responsible for the jury costs.

					This local rule is being implemented to comply with the mandate of the Ohio Supreme Court that each municipal court develop and implement a jury management plan prior to July 1, 1994.
				</p><p>
					(A) Jury Eligibility and Procedure for Jury Selection
					Juror eligibility shall be determined and prospective jurors shall be selected by the jury commission of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas in accordance with its policies and procedures for potential service with the Barberton Municipal Court.
				</p><p>
					(B) Summoning of Prospective Jurors<br>
					Prospective jurors shall be summoned only on the filing of a written jury demand or under circumstances when the Defendant is entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right.
				</p><p>
					Every effort shall be made to resolve cases prior to summoning juries. A jury panel shall not be summoned unless it appears that there is a substantial likelihood of trial.
				</p><p>
					(C) Examination of Prospective Jurors<br>
					Examination of prospective jurors shall be limited to matters relevant to the matter before the Court and to determine the juror's fairness and impartiality.
				</p><p>
					All prospective jurors shall be placed under oath in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code. The Court may conduct a preliminary voir dire examination concerning basic and relevant matters, and counsel shall be permitted a reasonable period of time to question panel members thereafter. Counsel or parties shall conform their voir dire questioning to the following rules: 
				</p><p>
					1. The case may not be argued in any way while questioning the jurors.
				</p><p>
					2. Counsel may not engage in efforts to indoctrinate jurors.
				</p><p>
					3. Jurors may not be questioned concerning anticipated instructions or theories of law. This does not prevent general questions concerning the validity and philosophy of reasonable doubt or the presumption of innocence.
				</p><p>
					4. Jurors may not be asked what kind of verdict they might return under any circumstance.
				</p><p>
					5. Questions are to be asked collectively of the entire panel whenever possible.
				</p><p>
					In the event there exists a potential for sensitive or potentially invasive questions, the Court or the parties may request a hearing preceding voir dire to consider these questions.
				</p><p>
					In all cases, voir dire may be held on the record, and may be conducted outside the presence of other jurors in order to protect juror privacy, or to avoid juror embarrassment.
				</p><p>
					If it is determined by the Court during the voir dire process that an individual is unable or unwilling to sit in a particular case fairly and impartially, the individual may be removed from the panel for cause. Such motion for removal for cause may be made by counsel, a party if unrepresented, or upon the motion of the Court. Further, Ohio Revised Code 2313.42 or the Ohio Criminal Rule of Procedure 24(B) set forth additional cause challenges which may be made against potential jurors.<br>
				</p><p>
					Peremptory challenges shall be exercised alternately as presently established by Revised Code 2945.23, Civil Rule 47, and Criminal Rule 24, unless prior to trial the parties agree on the record to another method. Unless otherwise agreed, all challenges shall be made in open court. In special circumstances, challenges may be made outside the hearing of the prospective jurors. There shall be no limit to challenges for cause; however, peremptory challenges shall be limited to that number as established by the Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure.
				</p><p>
					Challenges to the jury array shall be made in accordance with established rules of procedure.
				</p><p>
					In criminal cases, the jury shall consist of eight regular jurors and possibly one alternate juror. In civil cases, the jury shall consist of eight regular jurors and possibly one alternate juror, unless by agreement, the parties stipulate to a lesser number. In special circumstances, additional alternate jurors may be selected.
				</p><p>
					(D) Jury Orientation<br>
					Upon appearance for service, all prospective jurors shall be placed under the supervision of assigned personnel and shall direct any questions or communications to such court personnel for appropriate action.
				</p><p>
					The Court may give preliminary instructions to all prospective jurors, as well as additional instructions following the impaneling of the jury to explain the jury's role, trial procedures of the Court, along with other basic and relevant legal principles as the Court deems necessary and appropriate.
				</p><p>
					Upon the completion of the case and prior to jury deliberations, the Court shall instruct the jury on the law and the appropriate procedures to be followed during the course of deliberations. In accordance with the Civil and Criminal Rules of Procedure, the parties or their counsel may request that special instruction be given to the jury.
				</p><p>
					A final jury charge may in the discretion of the Judge be committed to writing, and may be provided to the jury for its use during deliberation.
				</p><p>
					All communications between the Judge and the members of the jury panel, from the time of reporting to the court through dismissal, shall be committed to writing or placed on the record in open court. Counsel for each party shall be informed of any communication and shall be given the opportunity to be heard as to such communication. Under no circumstances shall counsel, a party, or other witnesses, have any contact with jurors.
				</p><p>
					All jury deliberations shall be conducted in the jury deliberation room. Jury deliberation rooms shall include space, furnishings and facilities conducive to reaching a fair verdict. Court personnel shall endeavor to secure the safety of all prospective jurors and shall arrange and conduct all activities so as to minimize contact between jurors, parties, counsel and the public. Upon the commencement of deliberations, all jurors shall remain in the care of court personnel and shall not be permitted to leave the court without permission.
				</p><p>
					Deliberations shall not continue after a reasonable hour, unless the trial judge determines that evening or weekend deliberations would not impose an undue hardship upon the jurors and are required in the interest of justice. Jurors may be consulted prior to any decision.
				</p><p>
					If jury deliberations are halted, jurors shall be permitted to be separated, unless for good cause shown, the Court finds that sequestration is necessary. If a jury is sequestered, the Court shall undertake the responsibility to oversee the conditions of sequestration and the transportation of all jurors.
				</p><p>
					Upon reaching a verdict, all jurors shall return to the courtroom where the verdict or verdicts shall be read in open court. Upon the reading of the verdict, in criminal cases, either party may request that the jury be polled.
				</p><p>
					Upon completion of service, each juror shall be given a personalized certificate of appreciation or letter of thanks at the discretion of the Judge.
				</p>
				
				<h4 id="lcrule-20">RULE No. 20 &ndash; CIVIL TRIAL DATE ASSIGNED</h4>
				<p>
					When a civil case is assigned a date for trial, the case shall proceed to trial on that date, unless the Court directs otherwise. If plaintiff is not willing to proceed, the Court may dismiss the case with or without prejudice.
				</p><p>
					If a civil case set for trial is settled, the attorneys assigned to that case shall immediately notify the Court. The Court may order an appropriate judgment entry or stipulation to be filed in accordance with BMCR No. 21.
				</p>
				
				<h4 id="lcrule-21">RULE No. 21 &ndash; JUDGMENT ENTRIES</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever a judgment or dismissal entry is required in any case, the Court may prepare it or order that counsel prepare the same. The entry shall be filed within thirty (30) days.

					(B)]<br>
				</p><p>
					(B) Scheduling Conflict<br>
					When a continuance is requested for the reason that counsel is scheduled to appear in another case assigned for trial on the same date in the same or another trial court of this state, or a federal court of the Northern District of Ohio, the case which was first set for trial shall have priority and shall be tried on the date assigned. Criminal cases assigned for trial have priority over civil cases assigned for trial. The granting of any other request for continuance of a scheduled trial is within the discretion of the Court.

				</p><p>

				</p><p>
					Persons charged with a felony and found to be indigent, in need of an attorney, and entitled to the same, shall be appointed a practicing attorney or the Legal Defender. When the Summit County Legal Defender's office is not appointed to represent an indigent criminal Defendant, the Judge sitting in arraignment court or the Judge to whom the case has been assigned shall appoint counsel from the list maintained for this purpose by the Akron Bar Association. While judges may consider the skill and expertise of potential appointees in selecting counsel in an individual case, judges shall make appointments in such a way as to ensure an equitable distribution of appointments of counsel among attorneys on the appointment list. At least once a year, the judges at one of their regular meetings shall review the procedure for appointing counsel for indigent criminal Defendants to determine if appointments are made in such a way as to ensure equitable distribution of appointments among attorneys on the list. (Sup. R. 8)
				</p><p>

Before the appointed attorney shall receive any money from or on behalf of an indigent Defendant for services on such representation, the Court shall immediately be notified and give written approval to withdraw to the attorney withdrawing with waiver of any fees from public funds. BMCR No. 23 shall apply to all appointed counsel.

				</p><p>
					If the Judge finds no probable cause for the affidavit, it shall be ordered dismissed, and the Clerk shall enter that finding on the probable cause docket. If the Judge finds probable cause, the Clerk shall assign to it a case number in the regular criminal index and docket and the proceedings shall be held in that case by the assigned judge as required.
