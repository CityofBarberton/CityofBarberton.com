				<p>
					Barberton, Ohio - The City of Barberton will utilize a new communications service, effective November 1, 2013, that allows us to send important community information directly to residents using the latest technology.
				</p><p>
					The Nixle Community Information Service allows us to create and publish messages to be delivered to subscribed residents instantly via cell phone text message and/or email. Notifications can also be accessed online at Nixle's web site at <a href="http://www.nixle.com/">www.nixle.com</a>.
				</p><p>
					Messages may include severe weather alerts, road closures, boil alerts, police advisories, and other relevant safety and community event information.
				</p><p>
					The service is secure, reliable and easy to use for our group. 
				</p><p>
					The messages can be sent specifically to residents registered within a 1/4 mile radius, giving them the opportunity to receive trustworthy information relevant only to their neighborhood.
					Residents decide from which local agencies they want to receive information.
					Subscribers can also choose the way in which alerts are received, whether it is by email, text message, or over the web.
				</p><p>
					Nixle builds on the foundations of other public-to-public communication services, such as Twitter and Facebook, but adds a key component: security.
					When citizens receive information from our agency via Nixle, they know it can be trusted. 
				</p><p>
					Residents of Barberton and those in neighboring communities can immediately begin receiving pertinent information via text message, email, and web by registering with the attached form.
				</p><p>
					We are very excited to have you experience it for yourself.
				</p>
