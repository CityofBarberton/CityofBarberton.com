## Fall Clean-Up Day
 
The City of Barberton’s Fall Clean-up will be held November 3 – 5, 2014. Residents who are part of the City’s curb side program are eligible to participate in the clean-up. In addition to normal trash pickup, residents may place **one bulk item and up to three trash bags (no larger than 30 gallon) or three trash cans** on the curb on their REGULAR scheduled pick up day. Items **MUST** be on the curb NO LATER than 7am on the scheduled collection day.  There will be a separate truck used for the Fall Clean-up and it will only make one pass through each area.  Any items on the curb in excess of the allowable amount will require adequate stickers. 
 
Unaccepted items include bagged leaves, tires, electronic waste (such as computers), construction material and debris, chemicals, and any kind of hazardous waste, refrigerators, and air conditioners. Whole house clean outs or court evictions will not be accepted. For additional information, visit our website at [www.cityofbarberton.com][1]
