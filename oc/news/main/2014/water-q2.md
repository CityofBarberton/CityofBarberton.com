#### PRESS RELEASE FROM THE CITY OF BARBERTON
 
The City of Barberton is obligated to report elevated levels of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids.
 
These are referred to as Disinfection Byproducts, DBPs, calculated by independent laboratory evaluations as a running quarterly average over four quarters, a full year; and, occur as a result of chlorination during treatment..
 
We are required to make this notification by Ohio EPA regulations.  Customers will be receiving statements by mail.
 
As before in the First Quarter of 2014, “the levels detected do not pose an immediate risk to your health”.
 
The city has active plans to correct the detected levels including advanced predictive laboratory evaluations using the University of Akron as a consultant; and, as supported by the OEPA, the construction of a Oxygenation System at the Reservoir in addition to intake extensions into the reservoir, rather than drawing raw water from the base of the dam.
 
This is not unusual for surface raw water and emphasizes the importance further development of our Source Water Protection plans.
