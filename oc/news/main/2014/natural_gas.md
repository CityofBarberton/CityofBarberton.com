#### Low Fixed Rate for Natural Gas Aggregation Program

**City of Barberton, Ohio (September 10, 2014)** – City of Barberton officials are pleased to announce that they have established a fixed rate for natural gas for members of the City’s aggregation program.  Residents in the program will pay a low fixed rate of $4.66 per mcf for all gas consumed during the months of November 2014 through October 2015.

City officials would like to remind residents and small businesses to look for a mailer to arrive on or about September 17, concerning the Natural Gas Aggregation Program offer from Constellation.  Residents and small businesses currently participating in the City’s Natural Gas Program will receive a rate change notice informing them of the new rate of $4.66/Mcf for all gas consumed during the  billing-cycle periods, December 2014 through November 2015.  These customers do not need to do anything to remain in the program and receive the new rate.  

Newly eligible account holders who receive their gas supply from Dominion East Ohio will receive an Opt-Out Notice from Constellation explaining the rate, terms and conditions, and means of opting out of the City’s Aggregation Program. These accounts will be added to the program unless they opt out as prescribed in the letter. 

Mayor Bill Judge said, "We are pleased to have been able to strike this low rate for our residents and businesses.  The $4.66 per Mcf rate compares very favorably to what residents can obtain on their own at this time.”  

Customers who have already chosen a supplier on their own will receive a letter from Constellation inviting them to actively join the program.  If you are served by another supplier you should be aware of the obligations in your existing contract before joining the City of Barberton program, as many suppliers charge a penalty for early termination.  Customers wishing to join the program must be in good standing with their bill payment and cannot be part of the utility’s Percentage of Income Payment Program (PIPP).

Bruce Stewart, Chief Marketing Officer of Constellation, said, “We are pleased to be serving the City of Barberton and look forward to growing the enrollment.  For those customers needing to take action to join the City’s program we’ve set up several means of enrollment for their convenience.  First, residents and small businesses may call Constellation at 800-718-1493.  Secondly, they may mail or fax the reply card that comes with the letter sent to their home or business.  Also, they may join the program through our website at [www.Constellation.com/Barberton](http://www.Constellation.com/Barberton).”  

The City is pleased to have made this program possible but asks that you do not call the City offices.  They are not equipped to handle a large volume of calls.  Residents should contact Constellation toll free at 1-800-718-1493 if they have any questions.
