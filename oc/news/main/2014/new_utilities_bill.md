#### New Utility Bills

Attention City of Barberton Utility Customers,	

We have received multiple questions about the new utility bills and we are hoping this will help answer some of your questions.

The purple bill you received in the mail is the new City of Barberton utility bill. As you can tell it is a full sheet of paper and the format of the bill has changed. The first change you will see is the message area is at the top of the bill, where you can find out about upcoming events such as the Spring & Fall trash pickup days, Mum Fest, schedule of tax assistance from CCA, etc. 

In the middle of your bill, is the breakdown of your bill. We have received multiple questions regarding the rate codes. Here is the list of rate codes to help you:

 - RW= Residential Water
 - DW= Discounted Water
 - BW= Brentwood Water (Norton Only)
 - CW= Coventry Water
 - MW= Multi-Family Water
 - JW= Jedd Water (Norton Only)
 - RS= Residential Sewer
 - OS= Outside Sewer
 - CS= Coventry Sewer	
 - JS= Jedd Sewer (Norton Only)
 - GB= Garbage
 - HS= Homestead Garbage
 - XW= Norton Surcharge Water
 - XS= Norton Surcharge Sewer
 - XB= Norton Surcharge for Brentwood Water
 - XP= Norton Surcharge based on # of people
 - STW= Storm Water

The payment stub is now located at the bottom of the bill. You would either bring that stub with you or mail the stub with your payment using the enclosed envelope.

Payments can still be made at 104 Third St. NW at the Finance Department’s walk-up or drive-thru windows, or at City Hall in the Utility Department’s Customer Service office. Payments made through your bank’s online bill pay can still be mailed to: 104 Third St. NW.  

Customers signed up for the ACH program through us don’t have to do anything. The bill will be automatically deducted on the due date and there is a memo at the top of the message area indicating this bill is your receipt.
