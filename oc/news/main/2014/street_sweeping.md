**City of Barberton, Ohio (March 31, 2014)** â€“ The city will be sweeping streets from April 20, 2014 through December 12, 2014, weather permitting. The street sweeper schedule for the City of Barberton is as follows:

Reminder: Do not put trash, branches, or grass clippings in the road. Basketball poles and rims are not to be placed within the street right-of-way without proper authorization as it will be difficult for our street sweepers to maneuver without causing damage to the equipment.
