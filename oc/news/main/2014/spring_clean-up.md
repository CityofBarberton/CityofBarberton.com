## Spring Clean-Up Day
 
The City of Barberton’s Spring Clean-up begins the week of May 19th.  Residents who are part of the City’s curb side program are eligible to participate in the clean-up. In addition to normal trash pickup, residents may place one bulk item and up to three trash bags (no larger than 30 gallon) or three trash cans on the curb on their REGULARLY scheduled pick up day. Items MUST be on the curb NO LATER than 7am on the scheduled collection day.  There will be a separate truck used for the Spring Clean-up and it will only make one pass through each area.  Any items on the curb in excess of the allowable amount will require adequate stickers. 
 
Unaccepted items include tires, electronic waste (such as computers), construction material and debris, chemicals, and any kind of hazardous waste.  Whole house clean outs or court evictions will not be accepted. For additional information on this program, visit our website at [www.cityofbarberton.com][1]
