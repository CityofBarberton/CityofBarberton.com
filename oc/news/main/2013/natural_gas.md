#### Low Fixed Rate for Natural Gas Aggregation Program

**City of Barberton, Ohio (September 19, 2013)** – City of Barberton officials are pleased to announce that they have again chosen Constellation Energy Gas Choice (Constellation) as the program’s supplier for another two-year program ending with the November 2015 billing cycle.  They have established a fixed rate for natural gas for members of the City’s aggregation program.  Residents in the program will pay a low fixed rate of $4.68 per mcf for all gas consumed during the months of November 2013 through October 2014.

Mayor, Bill Judge, said, “We are pleased that Barberton’s residents will have low heating bills again this winter.  We hope many residents and businesses will take advantage of our City’s program.”  

Service Director, Elwood Palmer, said, "Barberton’s expiring rate is being replaced by a lower rate that provides price certainty and the ability to leave the program free of charge at any time for any reason.”  Residents and businesses currently in the program do not need to take any action as they will automatically receive the new rate.  

Mark Berry, Director of Muni-Sales of Constellation said "We're pleased to continue to serve the residents of Barberton and look forward to growing the program’s enrollment. Newly eligible accounts will receive an opt-out letter from Constellation in mid-September.  Those residents and small businesses will be added to the program unless they opt-out during a 21-day period as stated in the letter.”

Any resident or small business currently located in the City and served by another supplier or Dominion East Ohio may join the City’s program by calling Constellation at 1-800-718-1493.  Berry added, “Residents served by another supplier should be aware of the obligations in an existing contract, such as early termination penalties.”  

The City is pleased to have made this program possible but asks that you do not call the City offices.  They are not equipped to handle a large volume of calls.  Residents should contact Constellation toll free at 1-800-718-1493 if they have any questions.
