#### Street Sweeping

**City of Barberton, Ohio (March 31, 2014)** â€“ The city will be sweeping streets from April 12, 2015 through December 11, 2015, weather permitting. The street sweeper schedule for the City of Barberton is as follows:

 - Sun - East side / Austin Estates
 - Mon - North end
 - Tue - Near westside
 - Wed - Far westside
 - Thu - Downtown area
	
Reminder: Do not put trash, branches, or grass clippings in the road. Basketball poles and rims are not to be placed within the street right-of-way without proper authorization as it will be difficult for our street sweepers to maneuver without causing damage to the equipment.

Cars parked on the streets between 11:30 pm and 7:30 am will receive tickets according to ordinance #6-1993
